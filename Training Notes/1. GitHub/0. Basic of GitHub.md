16. What is revert?

     The git revert command is a forward-moving undo operation that offers a safe method of undoing changes. Instead of deleting or orphaning commits in the commit history, a revert will create a new commit that inverses the changes specified.

18. What is stash?

    The changes we made in our current branch is called as stash. 
    These stashes can be moved to other branches, if we don't need to commit in the  current branch.
    We can keep these stash in the current branch and move to other branches and still can come back and access the stash and make further changes or commit these changes in the initial branch.

19. How to use stash?

    When you shift from new branch to previous branch, look for stashed changes and restore it if needed.
